# Lunar's Advanced Psych Fork

A bare-bones fork of psych engine designed to be soft coded in certain ways, but to be used with source code. Has support for advanced hscript integrated with FNF.

**This fork will stay on Psych Engine V6.3 unless major features are added to future builds!**

**Fork will stay unofficial, and never ever will be official, due to issues relating to ShadowMario & the Owner**
